A recreation of the Microsoft Initiative [BrowserChoice.eu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BrowserChoice.eu)
that will attempt to resolve the shortcomings of the original site.

>BrowserChoice.eu was a website created in March 2010 as the result of the decision in the European Union Microsoft competition case. The case involved legal proceedings by the EU against Microsoft and found that, by including Internet Explorer (IE) with their market-dominant Windows operating system, Microsoft had used their dominance of the operating system market to also create a dominant market position in the web browser market. The BrowserChoice.eu website was created by Microsoft to allow users that had not made, or were unaware of, a choice to try other browsers, and thus comply with the European Commission's ruling.

>In December 2014, Microsoft's obligation to display the Browser Choice screen to Windows users expired. Consequently, the BrowserChoice.eu website was discontinued, only showing a notice advising users to "[visit] the websites of web browser vendors directly". As of July 2015, the site is offline.

1. I feel like in recreating and popularising the website, less tech-savvy users may become aware of what browser choices there are, and so the competition between browsers may cause new and exciting innovations.
